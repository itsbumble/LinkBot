# LinkBot
This program opens a desired amount of URLs in a web browser based off of an inputted base URL.

I originally created LinkBot to find a bunch of randomly named 4-number .jpg files on a web server at school, but possible use cases I've found over time include:
- Crashing crappy computers
- Trolling your friends
- "Benchmarking"
